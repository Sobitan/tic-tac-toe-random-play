# tic-tac-toe-random-play
The reinforcement learning on tic-tac-toe game was created by The Lazy Programmer to show how an agent learns from a reward based system to take the best actions. In the original code the agents are assigned fix symbols during the learning process and the agent with the X symbol only learns to play the best moves when starting and the reverse is the case for the second agent as well. This code is an adjustment to that system where the agents sysmbol for each game play is randomly selected and both agents can be assigned any symbol during a game and the agent has to learn that the best move in either position. The result of this is either agents is better posed to play against the human as they are better adjusted to use any symbol during the game play
